# Peach Party

Peach Party is a two-player video game based on Mario Party. Players (Peach and Yoshi) move along the board and react according to the properties of the squares they walk over and land on as well as other moving objects. The player who has collected the most stars and coins during 99 seconds of gameplay wins. The [project specification document](spec.pdf) contains more details on how to play the game and customize the boards. Peach Party relies on object-oriented programming and inheritance to ensure that all game actors interact seamlessly. 

## Running the game

To play on macOS, first install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). To build and run the program, run the following commands from the command line:
- `make`
- `./PeachParty`

## Acknowledgements

I created Peach Party as a project for my COM SCI 32 class at UCLA. Professors Carey Nachenberg and David Smallberg wrote and assigned the specification.
